<h2>Product Description</h2><br />
 <br />
<h3>-What is your product?</h3><br />
Pocket Pickup is an Android application that allows users to set up and join pickup sports games based on location. When a user creates a game, they set the sport, date and time, location, and approximate event duration</p>

<p><h3>-Who is the target audience you expect to use the product?</h3><br />
This app will be designed for anybody to use, but just due to the nature of pickup sports, we&rsquo;ll primarily target young males. However, there will exist a market for older men (think more racquetball and tennis, less basketball and football), young women (it&rsquo;s harder for women to get random pick-up basketball games, because there are less of them), and older women (perhaps for yoga or group walks). </p>

<p><h3>-What problem does it solve?</h3><br />
 The problem that Pocket Pickup solves is the organization of pickup games in general. Pickup games are spontaneous in nature, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they should be difficult to set up and that they can&rsquo;t be planned ahead of time. Students at a college campus sometimes don&rsquo;t experience these difficulties, especially if they can just head over to the college gym and hop on a basketball court or soccer field with their colleagues. But even in that setting, it can be quite difficult to organize a game of football or baseball, which generally require more players, and even more so for less common sports such as lacrosse, hockey, or cricket. However, a large percentage of the population doesn&rsquo;t attend college, and so they only get to work with local parks or gyms that require memberships or entrance fees. Now imagine if a person moves to a new area where he or she doesn&rsquo;t know anybody, and doesn&rsquo;t know where popular gyms or parks are for pickup games; not even Facebook can help in a situation like that. Pocket Pickup, however, can solve all of these issues with its simple-to-use, map-oriented interface.</p>

<p><h3>-What alternatives exist, and what are their strengths and weaknesses? How will your system be different, from the user's point of view? Be specific.</h3><br />
A handful of similar apps do exist today, but none provide the functionality that we are interested in providing. The only related app in the Google Play store, Pickup Sports advertised many of the same features, but has seemingly merged with Spotvite, which advertises the ability to create basically any event. You can make dinner plans with friends, hangout at a local bar, meet local singles, and set up pickup sports games as just a few examples. This targets too wide of an audience for the purpose of just pickup games, resulting in that specific functionality being lost in the rest. This leaves the Android market empty. Another competitor, NextGame, advertises itself as a way to find pickup games in your area, with both an iPhone app and web interface. However, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any active users or upcoming games. The most successful alternative, InfiniteHoops, is a valid solution to the problem, but differs from our idea in a couple key aspects. InfinteHoops, as the name suggests, caters only to basketball players. The developers have other, less-used apps, such as InfiniteSoccer and InfiniteUltimate, but we&rsquo;d like to accommodate all sports in one app since it benefits users who are interested in multiple sports and doesn&rsquo;t detract from the experience of single-sport users. This would allow the app to have a larger pool of users and, in the long run, to gain more traction. Additionally, InfiniteHoops is completely location based and is cluttered with defunct games that don&rsquo;t apply to all users.

<h3>-What are its major features? Include at least 4 major features you will provide, along with at least 2 &ldquo;stretch&rdquo; features you hope to implement but that could slip to version 2.0 if necessary.</h3><br />
 The major features we plan to provide are a game finder, new game scheduler, user profiles. The game finder feature would allow users to search for games using the map with several filters, see game details, and of course, to join the game. The new game scheduler would allow users to create new games with certain settings.</p>

<p> Facebook integration will be used for all log-in purposes. This will simplify how we allow users to log in by using a single system instead of both Facebook and our own. This may limit the number of users due to people who are uninterested in linking their Facebook account, but we expect the extent of this to be small due to the pervasiveness of Facebook integration.</p>

<p>One stretch feature is to allow users to post on their Facebook wall about the events they have created or joined. This could be done either automatically when the event occurs or only when the user explicitly choose to do so. An added benefit of this feature is increasing the awareness of the PocketPick application among each user&rsquo;s facebook friends. An additional stretch feature is to make use of geo-fencing, so that users who say they will attend a game can &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; to the location once they arrive. When users are browsing nearby games and their details, they can see the users who plan to participate in the game, as well as their reliability ratings so they can better judge whether they want to join the game also.</p>

<p><h3>-What are its non-functional requirements?</h3></p>

<p>One of the most important non-functional requirements is that the system shall be very simple and user friendly. New users should be able to learn the basic features and navigation of the application without much effort. For comfortable and fluent users, no single action, like finding or creating a game for example, should take an inconvenient amount of time and should take as short as a few seconds.<br />
Another non-functional requirement is that the system shall be accurate and dependable in terms of both location and the live statuses of already created events. When users are browsing games, the details that they see should be up-to-date to within a few seconds.<br />
Another requirement is that the system shall be stable and perform well even under moderate level of concurrent usage.<br />
One more requirement is that the application should be customizable. Users should be able to set preferences in such a way that would keep the application most usable and convenient for them. For example, maybe they can limit the number of notifications that the application pushes per hour, or the types of notifications. Or maybe the user selects any and all sports that they will be interested in, and only those will be shown in searches and notifications.<br />
This is a bit of a stretch feature/requirement, but our design should keep in mind that location-based group scheduling isn&rsquo;t exclusive to sports. The underlying system should be able to adapt to other front ends that don&rsquo;t focus only on sports.</p>

<p><h3>-What external documentation will you provide that will enable users to understand and use your product? This could take the form of help files, a written manual, integrated help text throughout the UI, etc.</h3></p>

<p>One piece of external documentation is the help page of the menu. This would allow the user to get comfortable with the application and to learn tips and tricks. There would be notes and example motions shown on the screen that teach the user how to create new games, search for games, and navigate through the application. One other piece of documentation is an instruction manual with a full description of the application.<br />
