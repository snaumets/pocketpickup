<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
	For this set of user tests, we targeted users who come from a non-computing background, and made sure that they also have no prior experience with Pocket Pickup. The design of the user tests was quite simple; each facilitator was to get the application on a device, whether it be his own or the user&#39;s, hand it over to the user, and ask them to perform some central use cases with minimal assistance. The core use cases that we wanted to get feedback on were creating, finding, joining, leaving, and deleting games, but we were open to other general suggestions ranging from layout and content to extra features. We also planned to make sure the user felt comfortable and not pressured, so we allowed as much time as the user wanted to navigate the application and have some fun with the process.

<h3>User Tests</h3>

<p>
	Our first user test was run with Susan Larson.  Susan is a 52 year old homemaker without much experience using smart phones.  This was tested on her Galaxy Note 3, which was especially interesting, since this screen size and resolution had not yet been tested.  The application ran smoothly, and the projections and pin locations which could potentially have been incorrect on this new platform were properly placed and aligned.  Susan did not have a Facebook account, and so she logged in using Patrick&#39;s account.  She ran through the major use cases with no trouble.  The most interesting suggestions involved difficulty exiting the details edit text box on the Create Game page, and an uncertainty with what was supposed to go into the details box in the first place.  These issues have since been changed and committed.  All other use cases were intuitive and easy to use.

	Our second user, Casey Chandler, is a student at UW that is an undecided major, but is taking CSE142 right now and is planning on applying to Aeronautics and Astronautics. He was a supporter of the overall application idea and thought that it was in fact a strong solution to the problem of finding and organizing pickup sports games. The testing process, which was done one Sergey&#39;s Galaxy S4, took about one hour because he spent some time exploring the app after various stages and use cases. The first thing he had to do was to log in using Facebook upon opening the app. He had no problems here, but said in the long run it may be nice to allow non-Facebook users to also sign up and use the app. The next use case I had him perform was creating a game, and he no difficulty with this; he instantly saw the &#39;Create Game&#39; button towards the bottom of the screen, and thought that the form was simple and intuitive. I did notice that he clicked the ‘Create Game&#39; button multiple times because the app took about a second to go back to the main page and there was no acknowledgement to the user, such as a loading icon. This is something we plan to fix by the final version of the app. The next use case he walked through was finding a game. He had no trouble locating the button, and liked the layout and content of the form. He liked that the markers were unique for every sport, but one enhancement that he recommended was embedding even more information in the displayed markers such as a color (red/yellow/green) to show how close to the start time the game is or how many planned attendees there were. This extra color-coding for event attendance is a feature that we initially planned for, but has been set to a low priority now as we aim to solidify and polish the core functionality. After finding the games, I asked him to attempt to join, leave, and delete some games. Joining was straightforward since he saw the ‘Join Game&#39; button after tapping on a marker to display more details, and he had no complaints. He also had no trouble deleting and leaving games because he found the ‘Joined Games&#39; and ‘Created Games&#39; options in the sliding menu, and after viewing the details, he saw the option to leave or delete a game. At first, he didn&#39;t know why at times the delete button was displayed instead of a leave game button, but after I asked him whether a user should be able to delete a game after other users have already joined it, he understood the difference. One final comment he made is that he would like the ability for the creator or host to edit appropriate parts of games, which is something we didn&#39;t initially plan for, but will add to a potential to-do list with a low priority. Overall, he claimed that the app was intuitive and easy to navigate, which is one key property that we were aiming for.

	The third user was Isaac Green, an accountant with no programming experience but a heavy android user. He tested using Kane&#39;s Nexus. He went through all the use cases with little prompting from me. Like Casey, Isaac clicked on the submit buttons two or three times since they didn&#39;t appear to respond. His main requests were to add a list of who is attending and a game-specific chat feature. Overall, he liked the app and said that, with some additions and polishing, he can see a market for it.

	Fourth, we tested with Daniel Guillory. Daniel is a 20 year old political science major who is not familiar with the android ecosystem. Pocket Pickup was tested on Jacob&#39;s Galaxy S4 (This means he did not go through the entire Login use case; he logged in with Jacob&#39;s pre-logged-in application). Daniel was able to create and find games without any direction. He hesitated after creating a game, not realizing that the flag directly beneath his pin was the game he just created. It was not immediately obvious to him that the green pin represented where a game would be created. He appreciated how the map zoomed out to show all of your joined games when looking for your joined games. Overall, he described the application as “flawless” with regard to its function without any hiccups (i.e. no network-related errors or a choppy interface).

	Our last user was Annie who is a 22 year old UW student with no computer science experience. She really liked our idea, because she is a student-athlete who has found herself struggling with organizing pickup sports before. Even though she was very satisfied with the app in general and found it very intuitive, she had a few difficulties while using it. She did not find it obvious that the location in the bar on the bottom of the screen was showing the current address of the pin. Then she also did not understand right away that the location in the create game and find game menus were the locations of the pin. When she was creating a game at the IMA she had to go back to the map menu and verify that the address really is the address of the IMA. She said she did not know the address of the IMA from her head and thus was not sure it was the correct one. Instead of explaining this issue to her, I told her to look at the Help page. She found that very useful and had no problems with using the app afterwards.

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
	Overall, this user testing experience was a success. We had no problems finding five willing and non-technical participants to test our application. We also had no issues walking the users through our designed process, and getting useful feedback from them. The results show that, in general, users were pleased with the application that we have produced in a relatively short time period. They all thought that most parts were very intuitive and straightforward, that the application was attractive overall, and that with some polishing up, the application can definitely be a success in the market. We got some advice for achievable enhancements (before the final release) that would prevent user confusion and frustration, such as having an easy way to close the keyboard after adding some details to a game, giving the user a better indication after a button has been clicked and is processing such as a loading icon, adding a list of attendees&#39; names to the game details screen, and adding a way to edit game details. These should be achievable before the final release of the application, and some work has already begun. We also learned about some long term features that can be added to make the app much more usable and convenient, such as a game-specific chat feature and extending the app for non-Facebook users. To sum up, our group learned about the importance of getting user feedback from such tests, because it is a relatively easy way to get unbiased, real-world feedback and we received very positive feedback on our solution to the problem of organizing pickup sports games, which is very encouraging.
